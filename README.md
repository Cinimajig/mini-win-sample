# Minimal Hello world Windows application in Rust
---
This demonstrates how to create a bare minimal functional Windows Application, using Rust with [`no_std`](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html) and the [`Windows-crate`](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs).

The release binary with the Visual Studio Build Tools (stable-msvc) should round up about 11kB in size and be fully working.

**This is untested with the gnu-toolchain, but should work in theory, just be a little big bigger in size.**

Feel free to use this as your template/boilerplate code ðŸ™‚
